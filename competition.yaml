title: Shared task on Multimodal Hate Detection
description: Hate speech detection is one of the most important aspects of event identification during political events like invasions. In the case of hate speech detection, the event is the occurrence of hate speech, the entity is the target of the hate speech, and the relationship is the connection between the two. Since multimodal content is widely prevalent across the internet, the detection of hate speech in text-embedded images is very important. Given a text-embedded image, this task aims to automatically identify the hate speech and its targets. This task will have two subtasks.
